# Mi Band Tools

An attempt to make [Amazfitbip Tools](https://bitbucket.org/valeronm/amazfitbiptools/) work for the mi band 6

- unpacking kinda works, but it's missing stuff
- haven't tried to build from the json yet

*TODO:*
- check for missing WatchStates
- fix date not rendering
- fix calorie progress
- fix battery numbers not rendering
- fix steps/calories numbers not rendering
- add heart progress
